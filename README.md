<h1>First-Portfolio</h1>
This is my first ever portfolio webpage that I have created.
<h2>Project Description</h2>
This is the first webpage I have designed and developed. It was designed using Figma.
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>HTML - The standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>
<p>CSS - Stands for Cascading Style Sheets; CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</p>
<p>Figma - A platform that lets you design, prototype, develop, and collect feedback in one space.</p>
